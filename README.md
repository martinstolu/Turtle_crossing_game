# 🐢 Turtle Crossing Game

This is a beginner-friendly arcade-style game built with Python's `turtle` module. Inspired by the classic Frogger game, the player controls a turtle trying to cross a busy road while dodging moving cars. The game increases in difficulty as the player successfully levels up.
